/*
You are required to implement a circular doubly-linked list data structure with the class name
of MyPolygons, using a single sentinel node to mark the start/finish of what will become
a container for Polygon objects. The MyPolygons class must provide distinct methods to
	• prepend items into the start of the list (current item is the new first in list),
	• append items into the end of the list (current item is the first in list),
	• insert before a specified (current) item,
	• step to the next item (making it the current item),
	• reset the current item variable to the start of your list, and,
	• take (then remove) an item from the head of the list.
Note: that you may not have to use all the above methods in this assignment.
